üåü Project Highlights:
  * Goal: Build an AI model to classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones!
  * Make AI more fair and inclusive in dermatology ü§ù
  * Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) üß†

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution:
  * Dowload dataset from Kaggle Competition, place in Google Drive directory
  * Dowload Colab File
  * Run file to produce output.csv file


üåç Project Overview:

  Break through tech AI Spring 2025 AI studio. Equitable AI for Dermatology.  
  Build an ML model to classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones.
  Advance equity by centering those historically excluded in AI.

üßê Data Exploration:

Data contains main features of:
  * md5hash	(Object)	-- file name of an image without .jpg
  * fitzpatrick_scale	(int64) -- Integer in the range [-1, 0) and [1, 6] indicating self-described FST
  * fitzpatrick_centaur	(int64)	-- Integer in the range [-1, 0) and [1, 6] indicating FST assigned by Centaur Labs
  * label	Object (String) -- indicating medical diagnosis; the target for this competition
  * nine_partition_label	(Object) --	String indicating one of nine diagnostic categories
  * three_partition_label	(Object) -- String indicating one of three diagnostic categories
  * qc	(Object) -- Quality control check by a Board-certified dermatologist.
  * ddi_scale	(int64)	-- A column used to reconcile this dataset with another dataset (may not be relevant)



Model Development

After testing a variety of models based on image classification and recognition. Some models include
