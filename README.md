## **üéØ Project Highlights**

* Built a transfer learning model using keras applications and Xception to solve the goal of building an AI model to classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones.
* Achieved an F1 score of 0.481 and a ranking of #23 on the final Kaggle Leaderboard
* Used \[explainability tool\] to interpret model decisions
* Implemented \[data preprocessing method\] to optimize results within compute constraints

## **üìä Data Exploration**

Data contains main features of, provided by Kaggle Competition Description:
  * md5hash	(Object)	-- file name of an image without .jpg
  * fitzpatrick_scale	(int64) -- Integer in the range [-1, 0) and [1, 6] indicating self-described FST
  * fitzpatrick_centaur	(int64)	-- Integer in the range [-1, 0) and [1, 6] indicating FST assigned by Centaur Labs
  * label	Object (String) -- indicating medical diagnosis; the target for this competition
  * nine_partition_label	(Object) --	String indicating one of nine diagnostic categories
  * three_partition_label	(Object) -- String indicating one of three diagnostic categories
  * qc	(Object) -- Quality control check by a Board-certified dermatologist.
  * ddi_scale	(int64)	-- A column used to reconcile this dataset with another dataset
    
  üßê Process and Challenges: 
    - Preprocessing included removing possible null values, differentiating/limiting image sizes, and limiting a batch, epoch, and seed       size for later data training. 
    - Challenges included understanding the medical labela nd their role in dataset, highlighting md5hash label for output file.

## **üß† Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

ü§ñ After testing a variety of models based on image classification and recognition. Some models included:
  - Efficient B2
  - Efficient B0
  - ResNet50
  - CNN
  - and more...

We found that using an Xception model 
* Model(s) used 
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)

## **üìà Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, ‚ÄúThrough poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what‚Äôs happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.‚Äù
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
